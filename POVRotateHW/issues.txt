POV Rotate issues
The AP102 LED suck ass. I can't get the them to work with a shit.
I think switching to the STP24DP05 part would be a better option.
Need to put labels on P1 and the SWD connector.
Move parts closer together and make the board smaller.
Make the photodiode a top mount, with a hole through the PCB
